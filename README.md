# ncaa_nba_stats
Can one's performance in college basketball be used as a predictor for their NBA performance? 

to do list:
1) get stats of active nba players 
2) get stats of their college statistics
3) introduction - is college ts/fg/3pt/ft% a good predictor for nba ts? fg? 3-pt? ts?
    regression analysis - simple linear regression - 3x3 plot
    regression analysis - simple linear regression of true shooting 
    confidence intervals
    t-testing - reject/don't reject slope 0 (existence of a relationship)
4) looking draft to draft, what differentiated the good players from the rest? Was there any way to determine a bust?
    interactive plots from ... to today - distributions of various statistics (PER/ppg/apg/rpg/shooting splits) - see if anyone stood out. 
5) looking towards this year's draft

prob do this on jupyter.
